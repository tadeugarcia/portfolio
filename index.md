## More about me

- Started designing in 2007 with an online forum signature contest.
- AI enthusiast, I utilize Artificial Intelligence daily to assist me with work and personal tasks.

## Acessibility and code 

What sets me apart is a long-standing interest in understanding the background workings of interfaces.

In my previous role, one of the directors there, who was also a developer and a blind person, taught me so much about **accessibility: from best practices to using screen readers**, it was an incredible learning with him.
