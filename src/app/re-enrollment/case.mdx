## Start the project
After this project, every re-enrollment was done manually with human contact.

I designed the <mark>entire re-enrollment flow</mark>, including the part showcased in this case study as well as the back-office configuration section.

## Problem: Clarifying payment vs negotiation flow

The stakeholders were uncertain if users would understand the difference between choosing "Proceed to Payment" or "Proceed to Negotiation".

Using Maze, two unmoderated usability tests were conducted: one with the previous version and one with the new version, to test navigation fluidity and differences.

One of the post-test questions validated what the journey recordings also indicated: <mark>100% of participants said they felt very confident or confident about choosing</mark> between "Proceed to Payment" or "Proceed to Negotiation", and the subsequent page aligned with their expectations from that choice.

<mark>However, an unexpected problem arose:</mark> in addition to some misclicks, some users reported confusion on this screen due to two payment boxes appearing consecutively.

## Proposed solution
Utilize a step-by-step pattern to avoid confusing users about the existence of two separate yet sequential payments.

I don't have the exact numbers yet, but according to the responsible department, after this feature was implemented, <mark>the number of outstanding payments and re-enrollments increased significantly.</mark>
