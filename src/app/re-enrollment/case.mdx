# Payment of outstanding fees
How I designed the re-enrollment flow, automating financial processes and boosting debt clearance and re-enrollments.

<div className="project-details">
- **Squad team** Product owner, devs, and I
- **Role** UI/UX, Researcher, Recruiter
- **Tools** Figma, Maze
</div>
</motion.div>

<motion.div
  viewport={{ once: true }}
  initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
  whileInView={{ opacity: 1, y: [20, 0] }}
  transition={{ delay: 0.4, duration: 0.4, ease: "easeOut" }}>

## What were the problems?
Before, each re-enrollment was done manually with human contact.

<div className="project-cards">
- <TradeDownIcon/> Low conversion rate
- <UserCircle02Icon/> Needed an operator
- <Clock04Icon/> No previous version
</div>

## Designing the experience
After aligning with the stakeholders and the responsible department, I designed the <mark>entire re-enrollment flow</mark>, including the part showcased in this case study as well as the back-office configuration section.

    <figcaption>4. Choice - Payment or Negotiation</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>
</motion.div>

<motion.div
  viewport={{ once: true }}
  initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
  whileInView={{ opacity: 1, y: [20, 0] }}
  transition={{ delay: 0.4, duration: 0.4, ease: "easeOut" }}>

## Results

We were uncertain if users would understand the difference between choosing **Proceed to Payment** or **Proceed to Negotiation** (screen 4 above).

Conducted unmoderated usability test: users completed the re-enrollment flow (screens above) while going through the pending debts screen.
One of the post-test questions validated what the journey recordings also indicated: <mark>100% of participants said they felt confident about choosing between Proceed to Payment or Proceed to Negotiation (screen 2 above)</mark>, and the subsequent page aligned with their expectations from that choice.

However, an unexpected problem arose: in addition to some misclicks, <mark>some users reported confusion on this screen due to 2 payment boxes appearing consecutively.</mark>

<div className="project-cards">
- <Rocket02Icon/> 13 unmoderated tests performed
- <StarFaceIcon/> All felt confident regarding screen 4
- <AlertDiamondIcon/> Dual boxes led to confusion on screen 2
</div>

## Proposed solution
Utilize a step-by-step pattern to avoid confusing users about the existence of 2 separate yet sequential payments.

According to the responsible department, after this feature was implemented, <mark>the number of outstanding payments and re-enrollments increased significantly.</mark>
