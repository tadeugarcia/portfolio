# Payment of outstanding fees
How I designed the re-enrollment flow, automating financial processes and boosting debt clearance and re-enrollments.

## Start the project
Before this project, every re-enrollment was done manually with human contact.

## Designing the experience
After aligning with the stakeholders and the responsible department, I designed the <mark>entire re-enrollment flow</mark>, including the part showcased in this case study as well as the back-office configuration section.

## Problem: Clarifying payment vs negotiation flow

The stakeholders were uncertain if users would understand the difference between choosing **Proceed to Payment** or **Proceed to Negotiation** (image 4 above).

**Conducted unmoderated usability test:** users completed the re-enrollment flow (shown in the images above) while going through the pending debts screen.

One of the post-test questions validated what the journey recordings also indicated: <mark>100% of participants said they felt confident</mark> about choosing between **Proceed to Payment** or **Proceed to Negotiation**, and the subsequent page aligned with their expectations from that choice.

However, an <mark>unexpected problem arose:</mark> in addition to some misclicks, some users reported confusion on this screen due to two payment boxes appearing consecutively.

  transition={{ delay: 0.4, duration: 0.4, ease: "easeOut" }}>

## Proposed solution
Utilize a step-by-step pattern to avoid confusing users about the existence of two separate yet sequential payments.

According to the responsible department, after this feature was implemented, <mark>the number of outstanding payments and re-enrollments increased significantly.</mark>
