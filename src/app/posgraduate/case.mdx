## Previous design
There was no mobile version, and what loaded on smartphones was the reduced web version.

## Desk research
In the market perception analysis, compared to other institutions offering the same model of digital post-graduate programs, <mark>the university was positioned with the second-highest price.</mark>

In the benchmarking of the enrollment journey, it became clear that the user effort required to enroll using the website was much higher compared to competitors.

## What were the problems?
- We did not have a defined visual identity.
- We needed to <mark>communicate the aspect of a premium product</mark>, respecting the market positioning found in the previous analysis.

## Redesigning the experience
The redesign incorporated all aspects of the previous analysis. <mark>I created a style guide containing navigation components and a new color palette.</mark>

## Usability Testing
Using Maze, two unmoderated usability tests were conducted to test the fluidity of navigation and the difference from the previous version: one test with the previous version and one test with the new version. 

The 10 tests performed (5 of each model) resulted in <mark>57.14% faster navigation and a 67% drop in the rate of incorrect clicks.</mark>

Regarding the recruitment of participants, it was done by me, and a discount coupon for the bookstore was used as an incentive to help with this.
