# Premium posgraduate redesign
I redesigned the postgraduate course purchase flow with a premium UI, achieving 57.14% faster navigation.

## What were the problems?
The issue arose from a lack of a defined visual identity, leading to poor product-market fit and positioning.

## Desk research

**Benchmarking:** it became clear that the user effort required to enroll using the website was much higher compared to competitors.

**Market perception analysis:** compared to other institutions offering the same model of digital post-graduate programs, <mark>the university was positioned with the second-highest price.</mark>

## Redesigning the experience
The redesign incorporated all aspects of the previous analysis. <mark>I created a style guide containing navigation components and a new color palette.</mark>

## Results

Using Maze, two unmoderated <mark>usability tests were conducted to test the fluidity of navigation</mark> and the difference from the previous version: one test with the previous version and one test with the new version. 

Regarding the recruitment of participants, it was done by me, and a discount coupon for the bookstore was used as an incentive to participate.

The 10 tests performed (5 of each model) resulted in 57.14% faster navigation and a 67% drop in the rate of incorrect clicks.
