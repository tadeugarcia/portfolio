<p><strong>Tadeu Garcia</strong></p>
<h1 id="product-designer-based-in-rio-de-janeiro-brazil">Product Designer based in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil</h1>
<p>Currently, I&#39;m part of the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/maisaedu/mycompany/">+A Educação</a> payments team, where I&#39;ve been participating in projects from the discovery phase to delivery, working with user-centered design principles, universal design and design thinking. In addition, I already had the opportunity to work in other teams, such as e-commerce, which allowed me to expand my experience in digital products for education.I always try to establish effective and transparent communication with all areas involved in a project, especially with developers. This allows me to ensure that the process is fluid and that everyone is on the same page, resulting in well-built products.</p>
<p>Work permit: I&#39;m Brazilian and currently residing in Rio de Janeiro. I&#39;m in the process of acquiring Spanish citizenship, which will be completed by the end of 2024.</p>

<h2 id="more-about-me">More about me</h2>
<p>Sports, meditation, and tea are my daily rituals, fueling my creativity to craft exceptional user experiences. And to complete the checklist of a hipster designer, I&#39;m also a vegetarian.</p>
<p>In 2007, I started participating in <strong>signature tournaments on forums</strong>. Shortly after starting college for design, I began working in digital marketing agencies, then in a consultancy where I engaged in various projects, including a major project for the Brazilian Federation of Banks. I&#39;ve actively contributed to crafting engaging websites and apps. Proficient in design and interactive prototyping, I&#39;ve led two app projects, focusing on Material Design principles and web interface standards.</p>
<p>In recent years, I&#39;ve <strong>expanded my skill set</strong> to include <strong>moderating interviews, crafting user journeys, and navigating various product frameworks</strong>. My strong interpersonal skills enable me to cultivate close relationships within my team and remain readily available to provide support.</p>
<h2 id="designer-who-codes">Designer who codes</h2>
<p>What sets me apart is my genuine <strong>curiosity about the inner workings of interfaces</strong> and my commitment to delivering exceptional user experiences.</p>
<p>In my previous role, I focused on building the front-end, handing it over to the developers to work on the back end. This, along with starting my career as an art director, has given me a strong UI skill set today.</p>
<p>One of the directors there, who was also a <strong>developer and visually impaired, taught me many things about accessibility</strong>. From best practices to using screen readers alongside him, it was an incredible learning experience for me.</p>
